A major update bringing intelligent namespace context for AI models, localization fallback support, and our move to open source.

## What's New

- **Namespace Context for AI** - AI models can now attach rich context (description, team, domain, AI prompt, tags) when creating or updating keys. This helps models understand how translations should be crafted for each namespace.
- **Localization Fallback** - When adding a new language, missing keys automatically inherit from the fallback language. No more broken translations or key errors in your app.
- **Relational Namespaces** - Translation keys now have a proper relational connection to namespaces for better organization and querying.
- **Open Source Release** - Packages, MCP server, and landing page are now public at [github.com/better-i18n/oss](https://github.com/better-i18n/oss)

## Improvements

- **Faster Gemini Streaming** - Optimized system prompts for significantly faster streaming with Gemini models
- **Smarter Key Mentions** - Keys mentioned in AI chat now include their namespace context, enabling precise AI targeting
- **Redesigned Project Settings** - Completely revamped project settings interface for better usability
- **Enhanced Filter UI** - Improved filtering experience across the translation dashboard
- **CDN Republish Support** - Deleting CDN files now resets the published status, allowing clean republishing

## Platform Changes

- **GitHub Integration** - Moved to "Coming Soon" as we prioritize CDN stability and performance
- **Organization Repository** - Migrated to a proper org structure for better maintainability
