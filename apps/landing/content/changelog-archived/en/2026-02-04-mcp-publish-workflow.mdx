AI assistants can now publish translations directly from your IDE. This release completes the MCP workflow with publish tools, fixes critical data integrity issues, and improves the overall developer experience.

## What's New

- **MCP Publish Tools** - Two new MCP tools: `getPendingChanges` to preview what will be deployed, and `publish` to deploy translations to CDN or GitHub — all from your IDE
- **Complete MCP Workflow** - AI assistants can now follow the full cycle: read → translate → verify → publish → confirm, without leaving the editor
- **Pending Publish Hints** - Write operations (`createKeys`, `updateKeys`) now return hints reminding AI to call `publish` when changes are ready
- **MCP Router Documentation** - Comprehensive tool documentation with categories (READ, QUERY, WRITE, PUBLISH, MONITOR) and recommended workflow guide

## Improvements

- **Safer Key Recreation** - Fixed soft-delete rename by combining find, rename, and insert into a single database transaction, preventing conflicts on Hyperdrive connection pools
- **Better Chat Compaction** - `/compact` command now shows the user message in chat and replaces the placeholder text with actual summarization content
- **Default CDN Format** - Changed default format from `JSON_FLAT` to `JSON_NESTED` for better compatibility with i18n libraries
- **CDN Fallback by Default** - New projects automatically get fallback language support enabled
- **Language Sorting** - Languages are now sorted by status: active → draft → archived

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed slash command auto-submit preventing double submission
- Removed deprecated summarization tool from server-side (now client-only)
