Better i18n CLI helps you manage the entire lifecycle of your translation keys, from detecting hardcoded strings to auditing remote sync status.

## Core Capabilities

- **`scan`**: Find hardcoded strings that need translation.
- **`check`**: Interactive checker for missing and unused translation keys (focused, user-friendly).
- **`sync`**: Compare your local `t()` calls with Better i18n cloud (Remote) and detect missing or unused keys (full audit).

## Why use the CLI?

Managing i18n manually is error-prone. The CLI provides a "Senior Tooling" experience to ensure your translations are always consistent and fully covered.

```tsx
// ❌ Detected by 'scan'
<h1>Welcome to our app</h1>

// ✅ Analyzed by 'sync'
<h1>{t('welcome')}</h1> // Linked to 'home.welcome' namespace
```

## Installation

```bash
# With npx (no install needed)
npx @better-i18n/cli scan

# Or install globally
npm install -g @better-i18n/cli
```

## Workflow

1.  **Scan**: Run `better-i18n scan` to find untranslated text.
2.  **Translate**: Wrap text with `t()` calls using `@better-i18n/next`.
3.  **Check**: Run `better-i18n check` for interactive, focused checks (missing OR unused).
4.  **Sync**: Run `better-i18n sync` for full audit (both missing AND unused).

## Features

- ✅ **Lexical Scope Tracking** - Smart namespace detection for both `useTranslations` and `getTranslations`.
- ✅ **Server Component Support** - Full support for Next.js App Router async server functions.
- ✅ **Compact Tree Output** - Human-readable grouping of missing/unused keys.
- ✅ **Senior Audit Log** - Deep transparency with `--verbose`.
- ✅ **CI/CD Ready** - Enforce 100% key coverage in your pipeline.
- ✅ **Smart Filtering** - Automatically ignores CSS, URLs, and constants.
