Focused translation key checker with interactive prompts and targeted analysis. Check for missing keys, unused keys, or both with a user-friendly interface.

## When to use check

The `check` command provides a streamlined experience for specific auditing scenarios:

- **Before pushing code**: Quickly verify new translation keys are uploaded.
- **Cleaning up translations**: Focus only on unused keys without noise.
- **Interactive workflow**: Let the CLI guide you through what to check.
- **Targeted analysis**: Get only the report you need (missing OR unused).
- **First-time users**: Interactive prompts make it easy to get started.

## Commands

### `better-i18n check`

Interactive mode - the CLI asks what you want to check and shows only relevant results.

```bash
better-i18n check

# Interactive prompt:
? What would you like to check?
  ❯ Missing translation keys
    Unused translation keys
    Both (Full Comparison)
```

### `better-i18n check:missing`

Check for keys used in code but not in Better i18n remote (skips unused analysis).

```bash
better-i18n check:missing

# Output includes:
# ✓ Coverage: Local → Remote
# ⊕ Missing in Remote (N keys)
```

### `better-i18n check:unused`

Check for keys in Better i18n but not detected in code (skips missing analysis).

```bash
better-i18n check:unused

# Output includes:
# ✓ Coverage: Remote Used
# 🔍 Used via Dynamic Patterns
# ⊖ Possibly Unused (N keys)
```

## Difference from `sync`

| Feature | `check` | `sync` |
|---------|---------|--------|
| **Interactive** | ✅ Asks what to check | ❌ Always full comparison |
| **Targeted reports** | ✅ Only shows what you need | ❌ Shows everything |
| **Subcommands** | ✅ `check:missing`, `check:unused` | ❌ Single command |
| **Best for** | Quick focused checks | Full audits & CI |
| **Output** | Filtered by selection | Complete comparison |

**Use `check` when**: You want a quick, focused check with interactive guidance.
**Use `sync` when**: You need the full picture or running in CI/CD.

## Usage

```bash
# Interactive - asks what to check
better-i18n check

# Direct - check only missing keys
better-i18n check:missing

# Direct - check only unused keys
better-i18n check:unused

# With options
better-i18n check:missing --verbose
better-i18n check:unused -d ./src
better-i18n check --format json
```

## Options

All `check` commands support the same options:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-d, --dir <path>` | Directory to scan (default: current directory) |
| `--format <type>` | Output format: `eslint` (human-readable) or `json` (machine) |
| `--verbose` | Show detailed audit log with scoping summary and key probes |

📊 Translation Keys Comparison
Source locale: en

Coverage:
  Remote Used: 63% (remote keys detected in code)

🔍 Used via Dynamic Patterns (127 keys)
  These keys are accessed through template literals like t(`plans.${x}.name`)
  Detected patterns:

  plans.${planId}.name (15 keys)
    └─ PricingPage.tsx:42
       → plans.starter.name
       → plans.pro.name
       → plans.enterprise.name
       ... and 12 more

  ⚠️  WARNING: Do NOT delete these keys without manual verification!
  The CLI detected these keys through pattern matching, but cannot guarantee
  100% accuracy. Review the source code before deleting any keys.

⊖ Possibly Unused (386 keys)
  Static keys not detected in code - safe to review for deletion

## Workflow Examples

### Before Opening a PR

```bash
# Quick check for missing keys
better-i18n check:missing

# If issues found, add them via Dashboard/AI
# Then verify
better-i18n check:missing  # Should show 0 missing
```

### Cleaning Up Old Translations

```bash
# Focus only on unused keys
better-i18n check:unused

# Review the "Possibly Unused" section
# Check dynamic patterns warnings
# Delete safe-to-remove keys via Dashboard
```

### First Time Running

```bash
# Interactive mode guides you
better-i18n check

# Choose what matters most right now:
# - Missing: Ensure your new features are translated
# - Unused: Clean up technical debt
# - Both: Full audit (same as 'sync')
```

---

## Advanced: Dynamic Pattern Detection

The `check:unused` command includes intelligent pattern matching for template literals:

```tsx
// This code pattern...
const planId = 'pro';
t(`plans.${planId}.name`);  // Dynamic key access

// ...will detect these remote keys as "used":
// - plans.starter.name
// - plans.pro.name
// - plans.enterprise.name
```

**Why this matters**: Keys matched by dynamic patterns are NOT marked as "unused" even if no static `t('plans.pro.name')` call exists. The CLI shows these as "Used via Dynamic Patterns" with a warning to review before deletion.

## JSON Output

All `check` commands support `--format json`:

```bash
better-i18n check:missing --format json | jq '.comparison.missingCount'
# Output: 473

better-i18n check:unused --format json | jq '.comparison.possiblyUnusedCount'
# Output: 386
```
