---

Better i18n takes security seriously. This page outlines our security practices and how we protect your data.

## Infrastructure

### Hosting

- **Cloudflare Workers** - Edge computing with built-in DDoS protection
- **Cloudflare R2** - Object storage for translation files
- **PlanetScale** - Serverless MySQL with automatic backups

### Data Centers

All data is processed and stored in secure data centers with:

- SOC 2 Type II certification
- ISO 27001 compliance
- GDPR compliance

## Authentication

### API Keys

- API keys are hashed before storage (bcrypt)
- Keys can be scoped to specific projects
- Keys can be revoked instantly from the dashboard
- Rate limiting prevents brute force attacks

### OAuth

- GitHub OAuth for dashboard access
- No passwords stored - delegated to OAuth providers
- Session tokens expire after 30 days of inactivity

## Data Protection

### Encryption

- **In Transit**: All connections use TLS 1.3
- **At Rest**: Database encryption using AES-256

### Access Control

- Role-based access control (RBAC) at organization level
- Audit logs for all sensitive operations
- Principle of least privilege for internal access

## Translation Data

### What We Store

- Translation keys and values
- Namespace metadata
- Sync history and logs

### What We Don't Store

- Source code (only translation files)
- Credentials or secrets
- Personal user data beyond what's needed for the service

## GitHub Integration

### Permissions

We request minimal GitHub permissions:

- **Repository Contents**: Read/write translation files only
- **Pull Requests**: Create PRs for translation updates
- **Webhooks**: Receive push events for sync

### Data Flow

1. We only access files matching your configured patterns (e.g., `locales/**/*.json`)
2. Translation files are synced to our database
3. Updates are pushed back as pull requests
4. You maintain full control over merging

## Responsible Disclosure

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it to:

**security@better-i18n.com**

We will:

- Acknowledge receipt within 24 hours
- Provide an initial assessment within 72 hours
- Keep you informed of our progress
- Credit you in our security acknowledgments (if desired)

Please do not disclose vulnerabilities publicly until we've had a chance to address them.

## Compliance

### GDPR

- Data processing agreements available
- Right to erasure supported
- Data export available on request

### SOC 2

We are currently working toward SOC 2 Type II certification.
