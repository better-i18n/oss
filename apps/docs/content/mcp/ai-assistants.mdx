Better i18n provides a **remote MCP server** that AI assistants can connect to directly via URL. No installation required — just paste the server URL and sign in with your Better i18n account.

```
https://mcp.better-i18n.com/mcp
```

<Callout type="info">
  Unlike [coding agents](/mcp/getting-started) that run a local MCP process via `npx`, AI assistants connect to the hosted server over HTTP and authenticate via OAuth.

    <Steps>
      <Step>
        ### Open ChatGPT Settings

        Go to **Settings > MCP Tools** (or click the MCP icon in the chat input).
      </Step>

      <Step>
        ### Add MCP Server

        Click **"Add MCP server"** and paste the server URL:

        ```
        https://mcp.better-i18n.com/mcp
        ```
      </Step>

      <Step>
        ### Authorize

        ChatGPT will redirect you to the Better i18n sign-in page. Log in with your account and authorize access.

        Once authorized, ChatGPT will discover all available **translation tools** automatically.
      </Step>

      <Step>
        ### Start Using

        Ask ChatGPT to manage your translations:

        > "Show me all projects in my Better i18n workspace."

        > "Find all missing Turkish translations in my project."

        > "Create a new key `auth.welcome` with source text 'Welcome back' and translate it to German and French."
      </Step>
    </Steps>

  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Claude">
    <Steps>
      <Step>
        ### Open Claude Settings

        Go to [claude.ai](https://claude.ai) and navigate to **Settings > Integrations**.
      </Step>

      <Step>
        ### Add MCP Integration

        Click **"Add integration"** and enter the server URL:

        ```
        https://mcp.better-i18n.com/mcp
        ```
      </Step>

      <Step>
        ### Authorize

        Claude will redirect you to sign in to your Better i18n account. Authorize the connection.
      </Step>

      <Step>
        ### Start Using

        Ask Claude to work with your translations:

        > "List my translation projects and show coverage for each language."

        > "Update the Turkish translation for `nav.home` to 'Ana Sayfa'."
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    <Callout type="info">
      This is for **Claude on the web** (claude.ai). For **Claude Desktop** (the desktop app), use the [local MCP setup](/mcp/getting-started) instead, which runs via `npx`.

## How It Works

```
AI Assistant → HTTPS → mcp.better-i18n.com/mcp → Better i18n API
                              │
                        OAuth 2.1 Auth
                              │
                     dash.better-i18n.com
```

1. **Connect**: The AI assistant connects to the remote MCP server over HTTPS.
2. **Authenticate**: OAuth 2.1 flow redirects you to sign in with your Better i18n account.
3. **Discover**: The assistant discovers all available translation tools automatically.
4. **Execute**: When you ask a question, the assistant calls the appropriate tools on your behalf.

Your OAuth session lasts **30 days**. After that, the assistant will prompt you to re-authorize.

## Remote vs Local MCP

| | Remote (AI Assistants) | Local (Coding Agents) |
|---|---|---|
| **Setup** | Paste URL + sign in | `npx @better-i18n/mcp` + API key |
| **Auth** | OAuth 2.1 (browser sign-in) | API key in env variable |
| **Clients** | ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini | Cursor, Claude Desktop, Windsurf |
| **Transport** | Streamable HTTP | stdio |
| **Use case** | Chat-based translation management | IDE-integrated workflows |

Both methods give access to the same set of [translation tools](/mcp/tool-reference).

## Content MCP Server

If you also use Better i18n's headless CMS, a separate content MCP server is available:

```
https://mcp-content.better-i18n.com/mcp
```

Add it as a second MCP server in your assistant's settings. It provides 8 content management tools (models, entries, publishing) and uses the same OAuth flow for authentication.

## Troubleshooting

### Tools not showing after connecting

Disconnect and reconnect the MCP server in your AI assistant's settings. This forces a fresh tool discovery.

### "Authentication required" when calling tools

Your OAuth session may have expired. Disconnect and reconnect to trigger a new sign-in flow.

### Tools visible but returning errors

Ensure your Better i18n account has access to at least one project. Try asking the assistant to "list my projects" first.
