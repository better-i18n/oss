## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- 2744ff9: Ship compiled JavaScript instead of raw TypeScript source files. Packages now export pre-built `dist/` files with proper `.js`, `.d.ts`, and source maps — eliminating the need for `transpilePackages` workarounds in consumer projects.

### Patch Changes

- 76855e2: Fix: Remove private workspace dependency from devDependencies

  Removed `@better-i18n/typescript-config: workspace:*` from devDependencies. This was causing installation failures for consumers because the private package doesn't exist on npm and `workspace:*` couldn't be resolved during publish.
