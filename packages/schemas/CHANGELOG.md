### Patch Changes

- 89dd681: Remove "bun" export conditions that referenced unpublished src/ files

  All packages had `"bun": "./src/*.ts"` conditions in their exports map, but `src/` is not included in the npm package (`files: ["dist"]`). Bun runtime resolves the "bun" condition before "default", causing module resolution failures for customers using Bun to build their apps.

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- 2744ff9: Ship compiled JavaScript instead of raw TypeScript source files. Packages now export pre-built `dist/` files with proper `.js`, `.d.ts`, and source maps — eliminating the need for `transpilePackages` workarounds in consumer projects.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- 76855e2: Fix: Remove private workspace dependency from devDependencies

  Removed `@better-i18n/typescript-config: workspace:*` from devDependencies. This was causing installation failures for consumers because the private package doesn't exist on npm and `workspace:*` couldn't be resolved during publish.
